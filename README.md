# readsensor
Networked Temperature / Humidity / Atmospheric Temperature Sensor

# Introduction

So one day I decided to do a small project involving a [NodeMCU v3
ESP8266
board](https://www.theengineeringprojects.com/2018/10/introduction-to-nodemcu-v3.html)
which I got ridiculously cheap (about the equivalent of US$5), and a
bunch of sensors for temperature and atmospheric pressure.  After
several false starts I finally managed to get the whole thing wired up
properly and now it's sending temperature, humidity, and atmospheric
pressure data to an [RRD](https://oss.oetiker.ch/rrdtool/) on my home
server.

Yes I know it's on a breadboard, but to be honest I kinda suck at
soldering and botched several tries at putting all this together on a
prebuilt perf board, and I'm not going to even think about making a
PCB out of all this any time soon.

# Parts List and Wiring

It requires only a few parts, total price was less than US$20.

* 1 LoLin NodeMCU v3 board
* 1 [0.96" SSD1306 128×64 OLED Display](https://www.adafruit.com/product/326) (This is not exactly the same as what I got, but it seems to be close enough)
* 1 [DHT11 Temperature/Humidity Sensor](https://www.adafruit.com/product/386)
* 1 [BMP180 Barometic Pressure Sensor](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1603) (Again, not exactly the same either)
* 2 4.7kΩ resistor for I²C pullup
* 1 10kΩ resistor for DHT11 pullup

Here's a rather ugly schematic produced by Fritzing for it, should
illustrate how everything comes together though.

A breadboard illustration from Fritzing might be clearer.

# Firmware

The firmware is in the readsensor.ino Arduino sketch. You'll need to
create an ssid.h file containing your network credentials, sort of
like this:
```c
#ifndef STASSID
#define STASSID "YOUR-SSID"
#define STAPSK  "YOUR-PRESHARED-KEY"
#endif
```
so that the NodeMCU knows how to connect to your WiFi network.

This just basically runs an HTTP server onto the IP address it is
assigned on the network, giving the current values of the sensors on
HTTP get to / (document root).

# RRD Scripts

To get started acquiring the data from the NodeMCU's sensors, there is
the rrd/make-rrds.sh script to generate the RRD files.  Edit the
get.rb script to reflect the address of your NodeMCU and the paths to
where you put the generated RRDs. When done, run the get.rb script
every five minutes using cron. This should populate the RRDs.

There is also a provided rrdgraph.php script that generates an image
(the output of the script is actually an image generated by rrdtool
graph itself). Make sure to edit the script so that paths point to the
correct locations of the RRDs generated above.
